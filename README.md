- <span style="color: red">**[Ongoing]**</span> **Bonus 1**: Save the game state in the browser so that it‚Äôs preserved if the player refreshes their browser
- ‚úÖ **Bonus 2**: Instead of having the computer randomly make their moves, try making it clever so it‚Äôs proactive in blocking your moves and trying to win
